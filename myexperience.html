<h2>My Experience Learning Web Development</h2>
<p>The course I chose to study at University is Business Computing, one of the modules for the subject is Web 
    Development. I have now studied this module for a whole term and I am very much enjoying it as I take a keen 
    interest in this hence why I chose it as my selected pathway for the course.</p>   
<p> Starting of learning web design was difficult for me, I struggled to remember the tags needed and always forgot to 
    close the tags. To overcome this, I went to more lectures and done my own independent research using YouTube and 
    other websites. This helped to increase my understanding for coding, which led me to be more confident in how 
    HTML/CSS coding works.</p>  
<p> I can type the majority of the page HTML code fluently. Examples of codes I didn’t remember before but remember 
    now are the hyperlink tag, which allows me to link text to another page (a href=" ">.) Next is the heading tag, this
    creates a heading and the size of the heading can be changed by adjusting the number in the tag. The higher the 
    number the smaller the text will get (h1-5.)</p>
<p> In conclusion, I am enjoying learning this module and wish to continue developing my knowledge on how to code HTML/CSS as 
    this will be very beneficial for my future employment. </p>                

<h3>My Design</h3>
<a href="https://wireframe.cc/KgtIcP"><img src="images/draft.png" class="draft" alt="First draft that I created."></a>
<img src="images/arrowright.png" class="arrow" alt="arrow pointing to the next image" >

<a href="https://wireframe.cc/t4762q"><img src="images/draft2.png" class="draft2" alt="Second design that I chose for my website."></a>
<img src="images/arrowright.png" class="arrow2" alt="arrow pointing to the next image">

<a href="https://wireframe.cc/LX38P2"><img src="images/final.png" class="final" alt="The final design that I came up with and stuck with."></a>

<div class="draftp">
<p>Above are three pictures that show my draft design, my intial design and my final design. The first picture on 
   the far left is my draft design. This is how I originally intended my website to look like. I decided that I  
   wanted the basic header and footer design but to have the navigation menu on the side of the document. I figured 
   this would be a convenient and open place to put it so the users will find it easy to navigate around the site.</p>  

<p>The middle one is the design that I changed my draft to. I changed it to this one because it had an increased header 
   and footer height, which allows me to include more information in the footer. I also wanted the header to stand out 
   more.</p>  
    
<p>Finally, the one on the far right, this my third and final design. This is the concept that I kept and am very  
   pleased with. I kept the increased header and footer design as I still believe this is beneficial. However, I 
   decided to move the navigation bar to the header. I believe this this is simpler and looks neater, it also creates 
   more space on the body of the web page.</p>

<h2>Site Validation</h2>
<p>After finishing designing my website I checked my code for each page ensure it was all correct and their was no
    errors. I done this for my HTML and my CSS code. My HTML code for each page came back the same five errors. whereas 
    my CSS check came back with zero errors, which I am very pleased with. Validation your HTML/CSS code is very important 
    as you can correct any errors that are on the page, it's also good as you'll be less likely to make the same mistake
    again in the future.</p>
