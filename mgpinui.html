<h2>Models of Good Practice in User Interface</h2>
<p>User Interface Design is the design of websites, computers, appliances, machines, mobile communication devices, and 
   software applications with the main intention of the users satisfaction with their experience and their interaction.</p>
<p>There are rules out there, that web designers should follow when creating a website to ensure that the interface 
    design meets the needs of the users so they have a good experience. These five rules are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understanding how UI plays into UX - In order for the interafce to be good, designers would have to rely on 
            information gathered from user experience. With this information a lot of work can be done on the interface. 
            Then mockups can be made, tested and approved by UX designers so the product can be launched without too many
            concerns.</li>
        <li>Know your audience - Once the audience has been identified, you can test out how our design is amongst them
            and take on their feedback. Feedback can be used to rectify and errors.</li>
        <li>Keep things simple and consistent - The website should be easy to understand and interact with. Users
            should't strugle to get around the webpage, as everything should be laid out and easy to understand.</li>
        <li>Implement a visual hierarchy - The most important elements on an interface should be designed to be 
            eye-catching and make users focus on them.</li>
        <li>Use colour and contrast properly - When working on an interface, it is best to make everything uniform
            and keep the same colour scheme throughout the webpages. Moreover, you should be sure that colours aren't 
            clashing (dark background & dark text).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Influences</h2>
    <p> Before I created my website I looked at other websites for inspiration, there are quite a few that were influential
        in my interface design decisions.</p>
    <a href="https://wwww.codeacademy.com"><img src="images/codeacademy.png" class="codeacademy" alt="Code academy footer"></a>
    <p>The first one being code academy. From this image you can see that I liked the idea of how to footer laid out 
        their links as it's clear for the user. They also had their social media icons placed in the footer which I 
        thought was a very good design idea instead of writing it in text.</p>
    <p><a href="https://wwww.schuh.co.uk"><img src="images/schuh.png" class="schuh" alt="schuh Footer"></a> <p>Another 
        website that influenced my interface design decision was Schuh. This is a shoe business that sells trainers etc. 
        In their header they have the navigation bar laid out in a neat and simple way. My navaigation bar was on the 
        side of my webpage until I was inspired by this one to change mine.</p>

    <h2>My choices</h2>
    <p> Before and during the whole process of building this website, my team & I met up with each other and searched for
        other webpages that was designed very well. We used it for inspiration to build our own one. Some webpages 
        inspired me to change my own design in order to make it more suitable for the users. For example, the navigation 
        bar - at first I had my navigation bar located on the right side of the webpage. After seeing Footasylums website,
        I saw that they had their navigational bar on the top left corner in the header and was laid out in a neat and 
        simple way. This prompted me to change mine and make it look similar to theirs. I prefer this design better to 
        my original.</p>
    <p> In order to keep improving my website over time, my team and I were constantly looking at other webpages to see 
        what we should add/remove to make the website good for the user and their experience.</p>
            
    <p> Doing this helped me to learn a lot of things about building a website. It showed me that maintaining a colour 
        scheme is important, hence why in my webpage the colour scheme is the same throughout. This makes it look more 
        uniform. Also, adding images helps to decorate the website more, which will assist in gathering more users.</p>  
            
    <p>Overall, my team & I went through a long process of analysing other websites which turned out to be very 
       beneficial as it helped each of us improve our websites. It also helped to improve our knowledge of webpages and 
       their interface design.</p>
