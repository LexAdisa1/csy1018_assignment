<h2>Want a job in Web Development?</h2>
<p>When it comes to Web Development, people assume this is the only job role. However, they're wrong! Web Development 
   isn't just one job, there are different types of Web Developer job roles that are available.</p>  

<p> The first one, is a Web Designer. A Web Designer deals with the appearance of the webpage. They pick the colours, 
    fonts, structure of the page, etc. They may then get a Web Programmer to convert it into code or - if they're 
    capable, they'll turn it into code themselves. The average salary for a Web Designer in the UK is around £31,000 
    per year. As for education, you'll need a degree in computer technology and website design in order to be 
    competitive in the job markets. You'll need to have skills in using coding software and knowing languages like 
    HTML and CSS, as well as using design software like Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
        
<p> The next job role is Web Programmer. A Web Programmer would deal with the more complicated parts of the web page, 
    for example databases and shopping carts. They may also be the person who converts the design that the Web Designer 
    has given them into the actual code that controls the webpage. The code that is required for a simple page of just 
    text would be very easy, so a designer with little programming knowledge may be able to do it. However, complicated 
    sites, like the ones with loads of items for sale require a professional programmer. Hence why you'll need a degree 
    for this job role in order to be a successful one. The average salary in the UK for Web Programmer jobs is around 
    £31,000. You'll need to have skills in using coding programs and knowing HTML/CSS.</p>  
        
<p> Another job role is a Flash Developer. Flash Developers deal with Adobe Flash. This is a software that lets 
    developers create interactive webpages with movement and sound. This would be useful for landing pages or even site 
    navigation. Salaries in the UK are around £41,000 and a degree is needed in order to get a profession in this job 
    role. You'll also need to have skills in using Adobe Flash.</p> 
        
<p>The final job role available is a Content Developer. Content Developers deal with what is being displayed on the 
    main part of the webpage. So, a content developer would basically be a writer, editor, a videographer or an 
    on-camera personality. For this job role you would need a degree. You would need to have very good knowledge of 
    HTML, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Macromedia flash and MS- FrontPage. You would also need good listening/writing skills.
    The average UK salary for this profession is £42,000.</p>
        
<p>Overall, all these job-roles are split into categories. There's the front-end developers who specialize in websites 
    and applications and the back-end developers who work with servers and databases. However, there also a full-stack 
    developer who deal with both at a time. A Web Designer and Content Developer would fall under the category of 
    front-end developer. Compared to the Flash Developer and Web Programmer who would fall under the category of 
    back-end developer. The Web Designer and Content Developer primarily focus on the things that the users are going 
    to actually see. Whereas, Flash Developer and Web Programmer are primarily focused on the behind the scenes of the 
    whole webpage. All of these job-roles require you to have skill in using HTML/CSS, as well as a degree. Moreover, 
    all of these job roles are important, especially for businesses as they will want their webpages done to a high 
    standard.</p>
<p>Personally, I would want a job as a Web Designer. This is because I take a keen interest in that subject, as I am 
    studying it at University and also have plans to open my own Web Development business in the future. I also have/am 
    developing my skills that are required for the job role. Here's a link to a website where you can find jobs like
