    <h2>Learning HTML, CSS and Design</h2>
    <p>Learning HTML/CSS can seem like a time consuming and difficult process, especially if you haven't got a clue 
       about it. However, there are many resources that are available on the internet that can be of help to you and 
       can teach you what you need to know in a few days. Learning these languages will be a huge benfit if you are 
       into Web Development as it means you'll be able to construct websites yourself and won't have to rely on or pay
       anyone else to do it for you. It can also open the doors for well paid jobs in the future as there is a high 
       demand for people with this particular skill-set. 

    <h3>Websites</h3>
    <p>Firstly, there are many web sites that you can use to broaden your knowledge, such as:</p>   
       <ul>
           <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> - This is a web developer site with step-by-step
            tutorials and references on the coding language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and Bootstrap.
            Tutorials, references, and examples are frequently reviewed by the administartor to avoid incorrect 
            information being given to users. There's also a search bar on the website that will allow you to 
            search for codes that you're unsure of how to write. I highly recommend this website as it's easy to use and
            the codes given are simplified and laid out neatly to help our understanding.</li>
           <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> - This website is basically a free online 
            course. Once you've created your account, you can get started straight away. Code Academy tracks your 
            progress which means that you can stop and start when you please and won't have to spend a considerable 
            amount of your time looking for where you last left off. Moreover, the website has forums where everyone 
            will go to ask/answer questions which is very advantageous as there are over 20 million registered users 
            on this site. Again, this website is highly recommneded.</li>
       </ul> 

    <h3>YouTube Channels</h3>
    <p>Not only are there websites but there is also videos that are available for you to watch that will be 
       very informative. The YouTube channels you should check out are:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy">LearnCode.academy</a> - They do free web 
            development tutorials, so if you need help trying to figure out a code or you're a visual learner then 
            this is one of your best options. They mainly focus on: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSS Layouts, Responsive 
            Design, React.js, Node.js, Angular.js, Docker, Dev Ops, Server Administration and Deployment Strategies.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">The Coding Train</a> - He uploads a youtube video every 
            week and covers a variety of programming languages like JavaScript, Java (with Processing) to generative 
            algorithms like physics simulation, computer vision and data visualisation.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Books</h3>
    <p>Furthermore, another resource available is online books. The most useful online book that I have come accross 
        is the Front-End Developer Handbook 2017. This is a guide that teaches people front-end development. It talks
        about how to learn it and what tools are used when practising it. The handbook is written in a profesional layout and aimed at people who are potentially or currently trying to
        get a better insight. It equips you with the learning materials and development tools. It can also be used 
        by managers, CTOs, instructors, and head hunters to gain a better understanding into the practice of front-end 
        development. The book also focuses on web technologies like HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, there's the search engine <a href="http://google.co.uk">Google</a>. You can 
        literally search anything on this search engine. So if you want to learn or figure out some code then a simple 
        search can lead you to thousands of results that may be of great help to you. Moreover, there's a site called 
        <a href="https://bento.io/topics">Bento</a> which was made for anyone, ranging from beginners to experienced
        people, there's information there that can succour you. The site directs you to the best resources for 
        learning on the web.</p>
